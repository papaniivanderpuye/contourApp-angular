Dear [Receiver Name]: 

I am a [College Year] student at [Name Of School] in Atlanta and am writing to you as a fellow alumnus. I am contacting you because I want to make effective use of my summer. I believe I would enjoy a career in [Career Industry] and I would appreciate your perspective on the practical aspects of working in this area. 

I am not writing to ask for employment at your office, but rather to see if you have 20 minutes to discuss [Career Industry]  practice in the market. I would also appreciate any suggestions you may have to offer as I consider my options for the summer. I will call you later this week to see if we can arrange a convenient time to discuss. I would be happy to come by your office. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me at [Phone Number] (cell) or at [Email]. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
[Full Name]
